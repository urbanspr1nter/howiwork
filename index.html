        <h1>Roger's Working Style</h1>
        <p>
            Here is how I work as of 2021.
        </p>
        <h2>Scheduling</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Work Hours</strong>. I work from 7:30 AM to 4:00 PM daily. My focus time usually 
                lasts until 10:00 AM, but I encourage you to contact me if something is important. Otherwise, 
                I will respond back at a leisurely pace.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Meetings</strong>. If the expectation is for me to be heavily involved,
                try not to schedule anything after 3:30 PM. I am an early riser and start my day at 4 AM,
                and so my cognitive capacity goes on an exponential decline around this time. 
                I also have to pick up my daughter at 4:15 PM, so please keep that in mind.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Context</strong>. Please give me some context on what is to expected in any
                meeting. I want help provide the most productive discussion possible in a meeting.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Contacting</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Teams</strong>. I prefer to be contact through Teams first. If I am not responsive, try email.
                If email does not work, call me.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Greetings</strong>. I really like a hello to start off the message, but I would rather have you provide 
                me with the reason why you are messaging me. If you need help, please detail what you need after you greet. 
                If my attention needs to be placed on something, please let me know too. Just a "hello" is not much appreciated.
                Online communication is asynchronous and thus very slow. If you need a response quickly, provide as much detail as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Tone</strong>. I am a friendly communicator. Please try to be the same. :) 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Timing</strong>. Ping me any time. Fair game that I don't respond right away outside working hours, though.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Code</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Reviews</strong>. Ping me for any help on reviews. I am more than happy to provide feedback. However, just be aware that
                if I have a strong opinion on something, I will finish my review session with "Waiting for Author" to block the review until I get the 
                response. Ping me if I end up forgetting resetting the status.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Style</strong>. I am an easy going reviewer. I don't nit. Chances are, someone else has done that for me already. :) I try to 
                be as constructive as possible. If I don't have anything to say in a review, I won't say it. There is no point in pointing out the obvious, 
                and if I have a "nit", you'll hear it from me personally. I don't like cluttering code reviews with things like that.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Productivity</strong>. I don't believe in LOC as a metric for productivity. I believe in regular, and productive status updates on 
                current work as a sign of productivity. Also, if I am stuck, I am not afraid to admit it. So don't worry, if I am having trouble, you'll know. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Learning</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Research</strong>. I count investigation and research as working. I will go into deep focus at times to study a particular topic, or perform an 
                investigation. I really like to share my findings, so if you're curious, please ask :) 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Listening</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Explaining</strong>. Feel free to start from the very beginning, or treat me as if I didn't know anything when explaining something to me. No worries, I'll let you 
                finish. :) It's always great to reinforce what we already know, right?
            </li>
